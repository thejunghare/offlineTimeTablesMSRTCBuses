## About the Project

The MSRTC Bus Timetable App is a mobile application developed using React Native. It aims to address the challenges faced by people in remote areas of Satara, where internet connectivity may be limited. The application allows users to access and view MSRTC bus timetables even when offline. By leveraging Firebase's real-time database and synchronization capabilities, the application ensures that users have the latest timetable information, which is automatically updated whenever an internet connection is available.

## Features

- **Offline Timetables**: Users can access MSRTC bus timetables even without an internet connection.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific bus routes or stops to quickly find relevant timetable information.
- **User Authentication**: The application supports user authentication using Firebase Authentication for personalized experiences and additional features.
- **Accessibility**: The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all users.

## Installation
To run the MSRTC Bus Timetable App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/thejunghare/msrtc-bus-timetable.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using a package manager such as Yarn or npm:
```
cd msrtc-bus-timetable
yarn install
```

or
```
cd msrtc-bus-timetable
npm install
```

3. Set up a Firebase project and obtain the required Firebase configuration details (API keys, etc.) for your project.

4. Configure the Firebase credentials in the project by creating a firebaseConfig.js file in the project directory. Paste the Firebase configuration details into this file.

5. Run the application on a simulator/emulator or on a physical device using the following command:

```
yarn start
```

or
```
npm start
```
This will start the development server and provide instructions to launch the application on a device or emulator.

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can interact with the MSRTC Bus Timetable App on their mobile devices. They can browse and search for bus routes or stops to view the corresponding timetables. The application automatically synchronizes with Firebase when an internet connection is available, ensuring that users have the latest timetable information.
